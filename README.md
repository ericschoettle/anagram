# _{Anagram?}_

#### _{Application tests for anagrams, palindromes, and antigrams}, {04/21/2017}_

#### By _**{Eric Schoettle}**_

## Description

_{This application tests if two words are anagrams of each other - that is, if they share the same letters. It also tests if they are antigrams - that is, if they share no letters. Then comes the fun part - are any of them palindromes? Are they a palindrome together (that is, each others' mirror images)? Lastly, it checks if they are in fact words.}_

## Setup instructions

* _Instructions for Mac:_
