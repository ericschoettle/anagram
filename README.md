# _Anagram?_

#### _Application tests for anagrams, palindromes, and antigrams, 04/21/2017_

#### By _**Eric Schoettle**_

## Description

_This application tests if two words are anagrams of each other - that is, if they share the same letters. It also tests if they are antigrams - that is, if they share no letters. Then comes the fun part - are any of them palindromes? Are they a palindrome together (that is, each others' mirror images)? Lastly, it checks if they are in fact words._

## Setup instructions

* _Instructions for Mac:_
* _Install Ruby_
* _navigate "anagrams" on your computer_
* _Installs Gems in Gemfile with 'bundle' in the terminal app_
* _Type 'ruby app.rb' in terminal_
* _Navigate to http://localhost:4567 in your web browser_


## Known Bugs

_The bootstrap link doesn't work and styling is, shall we say... lacking_

## Support and contact details

_I'd be glad to offer support if you find yourself using this app, but much less glad to share my email address. Sorry, the latter wins_

## Technologies Used

_Ruby, Sinatra, and the Mirriam Webster dictionary API_
